n_layer = 4 # The number of layers in the GPT

n_embd = 128 # The embedding size of the GPT, also often called the model dimension. It is the length of each vector processed by each layer. Tokens are converted into vectors of length n_emdb before any other processing takes place. The vector is split when processed by attention heads -- its values are partitioned over each head, so we require that n_emdb is a multiple of n_emdb

learning_rate = 1e-3 # This determines how much the neural network parameters change at each time step while training. This parameter actually specifies the initial learning rate which will probably be decayed over time to improve accuracy. Guideline: 1e-4 may be suitable for small models with 100 million parameters. For very tiny models (<10M params), 1e-3 may be suitable.

beta2 = 0.95 # This relates to how much momentum the changes in parameters are given, and therefore how quickly the network adapts. An AI assistant suggested 0.95 is widely used. Karpathy suggests 0.99 for tiny models, stating: "make a bit bigger because number of tokens per iter is small".

warmup_iters = 100 # There is another training phase called warm up in which the learning rate starts very close to 0 and increases. This is the number of iterations for warm up. When the number of iterations is large, 1% warm up would be typical. For tiny models, Karpathy states: "not super necessary potentially"
